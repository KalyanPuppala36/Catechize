# Project: Catechize - An Interactive Quiz Program in C
 Welcome to Catechize! ðŸ˜Š

Introducing Catechize, a captivating quiz program I've crafted entirely on my own. With over 3,370 lines of code that I personally wrote using the Vim editor in the Ubuntu terminal, I'm thrilled to showcase my achievement.

Let's dive into the world of Catechize and its exciting features:

Personalization: The journey kicks off with a friendly welcome, prompting users to provide their names for a personalized touch.

Diverse Topics: Catechize offers an array of intriguing topics, ranging from current affairs and sports to movies. Whether you're an all-rounder or a niche enthusiast, there's something for everyone.

Challenge Levels: Prepare to be challenged! I've incorporated three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each difficulty includes three rounds of questions.

Question Rounds: The quiz comprises three rounds, each with five thought-provoking questions. A correct answer earns 5 points, but beware - an incorrect one leads to a deduction of 1 point. And if you're unsure, you have the option to skip a round.

Scoring Excellence: As you conquer rounds, the program calculates your score. If you've answered m questions with n correct responses, you'll receive a congratulatory message along with your final score.
