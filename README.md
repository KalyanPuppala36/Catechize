# Project: Catechize - An Interactive Quiz Program in C

 <h2>Welcome to Catechize! ðŸ˜Š</h2>

Introducing Catechize, a captivating quiz program I've crafted entirely on my own. With over 3,370 lines of code that I personally wrote using the Vim editor in the Ubuntu terminal, I'm thrilled to showcase my achievement. (Copy & paste is not allowed in Vim, ubuntu)

<h3>Exploring Catechize</h3>

<h3>Let's dive into the world of Catechize and its exciting features:</h3>

1. Personalization: The journey kicks off with a friendly welcome, prompting users to provide their names for a personalized touch.

2. Diverse Topics: Catechize offers an array of intriguing topics, ranging from current affairs and sports to movies. Whether you're an all-rounder or a niche enthusiast, there's something for everyone.

3. Challenge Levels: Prepare to be challenged! I've incorporated three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each difficulty includes three rounds of questions.

4. Question Rounds: The quiz comprises three rounds, each with five thought-provoking questions. A correct answer earns 5 points, but beware - an incorrect one leads to a deduction of 1 point. And if you're unsure, you have the option to skip a round.

5. Scoring Excellence: As you conquer rounds, the program calculates your score. If you've answered m questions with n correct responses, you'll receive a congratulatory message along with your final score.

As the quiz journey concludes, Catechize offers you a choice: embark on the quiz once more or gracefully exit. Either way, the experience wraps up with a heartfelt "THANK YOU" for participating.

I'm immensely proud of my achievement in crafting this comprehensive program. With 3,370 lines of code, I built Catechize from scratch, showcasing my dedication and coding skills.

<h4>In Closing</h4>
Thank you for taking a guided tour through my Catechize project. By creating an interactive quiz experience and honing my coding abilities, I've developed a program that entertains, educates, and highlights my passion for coding.
